# Principal Component Clustering Exercise

## Employee Motivation Analysis – Nexus Logistics Solutions

## Overview

This project supports Nexus Logistics Solutions’ Strategic Analytics Initiative by uncovering what drives employee engagement in their Skills and Competencies Development Program. Using survey data from 600 employees, we apply unsupervised learning to identify key motivational themes and group employees based on shared preferences and attitudes toward training.

## Objective

Analyze post-training employee survey responses to:

Discover major themes in motivations and preferences.
Segment employees via PCA and k-means clustering.
Highlight location-specific insights to support targeted marketing of the Employee Development Program (EDP).

## Tools & Methods

Python (Pandas, Sklearn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
K-means Clustering
Descriptive Statistics & Chi-squared Testing
